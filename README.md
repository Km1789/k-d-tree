# k-d-tree
Implementation k-d-tree in three-dimensional case

The code is an implementation of a tree by dividing at each step the original parallelipiped containing the entire point cloud in the middle of its longest side. 
Moreover, each vertex contains the entire current cloud of points. The construction continues until there is only one point left at the vertices.
